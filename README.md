# Ternary kit

Ternary kit is a Conditions Pack for Oxygen Builder in Different Categories see list (Updating). the plugin is open source and the goal is to make it a **community plugin** with various ideas from everyone using oxygen. you are most welcome to contribute and add a spark ‚ö° to this repo   

## Condition List

- Mobile Detection 
- More to come...

## Installation

Plugin was tested on versions:
- Wordpress version `5.6`
- Oxygen version `3.6.1`

To install the plugin just `Download` the repo from the far right and choose the `zip` option. then upload to your wordpress website

## Updating the Plugin
I'm currently working on uploading the Plugin to Wordpress plugins repo, but it takes time and approval.
in the mean time all you need to update is to download the `zip` file upload to your site. wp will ask you if you want to replace the plugin just click `yes` to replace the current plugin, that's it.  

## 1. Condition: Mobile Detect

This condition is based on the popular lightweight library [PHP Mobile Detect](http://mobiledetect.net/). the condition lets you check if a `User-Agent` is on Mobile, Desktop or Specific Device like Android and iOS. When Return value is `true` element will show

‚ö†Ô∏è **Quick note**: Device detection in not 100% accurate in all scenarios. in some cases `browser-cache` can alter the results, but in most cases it works fine. see [Dealing with cache](#dealing-with-cache-my-anchor) section for solutions.

## Example

in this scenario we have a `Title` with a condition that checks if the device a user is on is an `Android`. if the condition is `true` the element will show to the user only on Android.

#### Available operators 

currently the condition accepts only the the `==` equal operator. in the future I will add more options

#### Available Options

```php

Desktop # Checks if Desktop / Returns true/false 
Mobile # Checks if Mobile (Any) / Returns true/false
Tablet # Checks if Tablet / Returns true/false
Android # Checks if Android / Returns true/false
iOS # Checks if iOS / Returns true/false

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note using `iOS` option sometimes conflicts with other iOS devices and can return `true` for tablet or other iOS devices

üí° **Conditions are not updating in the Builder** please open a new tab and check for results. the conditions are made on the server so every change you make you must refresh your browser 

## Dealing with Cache
 In some cases when we use a caching plugin like `wp-rocket` etc, or either browser Cache the behavior of the device detection can change and not work as expected. in order to overcome this issue we can do 2 things either:

 1. Disable `mobile cache` in our Caching plugin - every plugin deal with this differently [for wp-rocket](https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/708-mobile-caching) this is the article
 2. Add a `display: none;` property to the element in the specific `breakpoint`  **preferred option** 

 for example

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/kelHgTU.png)  

Here I choose the `smaller than 768px` breakpoint and added the `display: none;` property to the element that has the `mobile detect` condition. so in case there is a problem in the detection the browser will detect the page width and won't show the element
