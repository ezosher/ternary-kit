### 1. Condition: Mobile Detect

This condition is based on the popular lightweight library [PHP Mobile Detect](http://mobiledetect.net/). the condition lets you check if a `User-Agent` is on Mobile, Desktop or Specific Device like Android and iOS. When Return value is `true` element will show

## Example
![](https://i.imgur.com/O4i2BrP.png)

in this scenario I have a Title with a condition that checks if the device a user is on is an `Android`. if the condition is `true` the element will show to the user only on Android.

#### Available operators 

currently the condition accepts only the the `==` equal operator. in the future I will add more options

#### Available Options

```php

Desktop # Checks if Desktop | Returns true/false 
Mobile # Checks if Mobile | Returns true/false
Tablet # Checks if Tablet | Returns true/false
Android # Checks if Android | Returns true/false
iOS # Checks if iOS | Returns true/false
```

**using `iOS` option sometimes conflict with other iOS Devices and can return `true` for tablet or other iOS devices**
